```bash
https://github.com/kartik3yaS/Shelf-YC-S22-task.git
cd Shelf-YC-S22-task
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**

   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://kartikeyashukla:KlLKfkRsjN79JaT3@cluster0.lnvzawa.mongodb.net/shelf?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

   ```
   **Note:**
   
      The provided `MONGODB_URI` is a secured, limited-access connection string with read and write permissions only to the `shelf` database. This allows you to run the           application locally using the shared database for development and testing purposes ‚Äî no admin privileges or access to other databases is granted.

5. **Start the application**

```bash
# Start backend server
cd server
npm run dev
